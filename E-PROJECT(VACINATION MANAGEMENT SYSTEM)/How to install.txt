>>> what is this  project 

Introduction:>>
In the existing system, Vaccines are provided for infants and children under teenage by various
aspects such as by attending school manually and there is a chance that some of the children’s and
infants may miss the opportunity of getting vaccinated due to some mandatory reasons. Which leads
to loss of life or gets affected by various diseases such as polio… etc? This is a time delay process to
wait for each and every one all over the places.

Proposed Solution:>>
We can change this manual system into e-vaccination system by collecting the info of infants,
registered under website so that those who didn’t took vaccination can avail one more opportunity
to save the life of their children . By this system a lot of man-hours can be saved and it is efficient
too.
